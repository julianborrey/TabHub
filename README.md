# Site for Online Debating Tabbing #

### Name ###
We need a good name. For now all we have is "super tab."

### [Blog](http://newtabware.blogspot.com/) ###
There is a [blog](http://newtabware.blogspot.com/) for this project.
Keeps non-techies upto speed with progress and allows full commenting 
power so people can steer us in the right direction or suggest cool features.

### What's going on? ###
Tournament tabbing in the world of debating is completely outdated.
There is no full scale tab out there which offers profiles, 
automatic tournament signup and
computed statistics pulled directly from the databases.

### Contribution ###
It is an open source project. Why?
* Should make for a better site.
* I don't have all the skill in the world...not even close.
* It's quicker to work with others.
* It will be an entirely free entity.

Some understanding of debating will be needed for somethings but when 
it comes to generic things like user accounts and the like, all 
experience is quite valuable. Please let me know/code something if you 
could see improvements. Especially in terms of reliability and security.
Areas which you can never fully account for. See the 
[Style](https://github.com/julianborrey/superTab/wiki/Style) page on the 
wiki if you are going to write some code.

### Never hesitate to ask me anything! ###
