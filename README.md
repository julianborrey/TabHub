# Site for Online Debating Tabbing #

### [Blog](http://newtabware.blogspot.com/) ###
There is a [blog](http://newtabware.blogspot.com/) for this project.
Keeps non-techies upto speed with progress and allows full commenting 
power so people can steer us in the right direction or suggest cool features.

### What's going on? ###
The only software used to coordinate debating tournaments which is 
entirely trusted is [Tournaman](http://tournaman.wikidot.com/)
here are a few online platform starting 
to emerge but they have proven not to work - often causing disruptions to 
tournaments. This project is another attempt to solve the problem.

We aim to create tab software which will facilitate automatic registration, 
automatically computed statistics and use correct implementations of algorithms
to prevent the same failures that other platforms led to.

### Contribution ###
It is an open source project. Why?
* Should make for a better site.
* I don't have all the skill in the world...not even close.
* It's quicker to work with others.
* It will be an entirely free entity.

Some understanding of debating will be needed for somethings but when 
it comes to generic things like user accounts and the like, all 
experience is quite valuable. Please let me know/code something if you 
could see improvements. Especially in terms of reliability and security.
Areas which you can never fully account for. See the 
[Style](https://github.com/julianborrey/superTab/wiki/Style) page on the 
wiki if you are going to write some code.

### Never hesitate to ask me anything! ###
