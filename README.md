# Site for Online Debating Tabbing #

### Name ###
We need a good name. For now all we have is "super tab."

### What's going on? ###
Tournament tabbing in the world of debating is completely outdated.
No one seems to have the full scale view of what should be done which 
is a site full of profiles, sign up to tournaments and automatically 
computed statistics pulled directly from the databases.

### Contribution ###
It is an open source project. Why?
* Should make for a better site.
* I don't have all the skill in the world...not even close.
* It quicker to work with others.
* It will be an entirely free entity.

Some understanding of debating will be needed for somethings but when 
it comes to generic things like user accounts and the like, all 
experience is quite valuable. Please let me know/code something if you 
could see improvements. Especially in terms of reliability and security.
Areas which you can never fully account for.

### Never hesitate to ask me anything! ###
