So at the moment, what needs to be filled out is the rest of the detailed 
institution pages.
Also need to complete the pages to show teams.
Also (!important!) need to find a way to shift rounds up and down.

Pretty much all the things from the user side needs to be set up.
In those page we need to have pages acting differently depending on what people/tournaments/institions have set:

Pages will display for:
Not signed in request -> almost all models
signed in request:
   part of institution
   not part of insitution
   alumni of institution
   
   tournament participant
   not tournament participant   

A cool use page would be: "Previous Oponents"
Chronologically show all teams debated against, Their score+position and your score in the round.+position
What the roud was (tournament + round #)
Link to topic, click and box shows.
Number of lifetime debates total under title.
Past motions. Score on that motion with position and percentages won from different positions.
   So a table which shows on this motion, CO won 34% rounds, and so on for each team


I can see it now:
1 stats page ==> side bar of bootstrap tabs which shows:
   past life time adversaries
   past tournaments list + speaker score and average of that tournament
   speaker point stats graph raw (diff strand for each format)
   can select strands for recurrecing tournaments
   also a strand of speaker points as a percentage of the average
   and as a percentage of the highest speaker -----> use D3.
   also something about success/failure as particular team
   and do these stats for regions and world wide!

Round_counter in Tournament:
Protocol.
< 0, tournament made, rego not open
0, rego open
(might go back to < -1 to close registration)
> 0, ( = i), we are in round i.
